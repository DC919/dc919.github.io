DEF CON 919 provides a forum for open discussion between participants, where radical viewpoints are welcome and a high degree of skepticism is expected. However, insulting or harassing other participants is unacceptable. We want DEF CON 919 to be a safe and productive environment for everyone. It’s not about what you look like but what’s in your mind and how you present yourself that counts at DEF CON 919.

We do not condone harassment against any participant, for any reason. Harassment includes deliberate intimidation and targeting individuals in a manner that makes them feel uncomfortable, unwelcome, or afraid.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. We reserve the right to respond to harassment in the manner we deem appropriate, including but not limited to expulsion and referral to the relevant authorities.

Anyone can report harassment. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact DEF CON 919 leadership via mail at dc919 dot net

Remember: As a community we can create a great experience for everyone.
